# NodeJS + ReactJS Boilerplate

**Welcome to node-react-bp!**

This is an incredibly simple NodeJS + ReactJS + Babel + Webpack boilerplate.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the git repository:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:davidvuong/node-react-bp.git
  ```

1. Download the latest version of NodeJS (as of now, v5.7.1):

  ```
  nvm install v5.7.1
  nvm use v5.7.1
  ```

1. Install all the project dependencies:

  ```
  cd node-react-bp/
  npm install
  ```

There are some really great resources online. There's a dump of most (of not all) of the resources I found useful when creating this boilerplate project:
